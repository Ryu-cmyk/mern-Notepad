# MERN Notepad

**MERN Notepad** is a simple web application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).
It allows users to **create, edit, and delete notes online**. This project is a part of my personal learning and black book projects.

## Features

* Create new notes
* Edit existing notes
* Delete notes
* Notes are stored in MongoDB database

## Technologies Used

* **Frontend:** React, HTML, CSS
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Database:** MongoDB

## How It Works

The frontend is built with React, which interacts with the backend server made in Node.js and Express.js.
The backend communicates with the MongoDB database to store and retrieve notes.
Users can open the app in their browser and manage their notes easily.

## Contribution

This project is mainly for learning purposes. Contributions are welcome if anyone wants to improve it.
